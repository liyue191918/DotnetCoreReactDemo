How to build and run the App?
  Ensure you have an environment variable called ASPNETCORE_Environment with value of Development. 
  On Windows (in non-PowerShell prompts), run SET ASPNETCORE_Environment=Development. 
  On Linux or macOS, run export ASPNETCORE_Environment=Development.
  Run dotnet build to verify your app builds correctly. On the first run, the build process restores npm dependencies, 
  which can take several minutes. Subsequent builds are much faster.
  Run dotnet run to start the app.
